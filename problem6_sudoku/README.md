📄 Problem 6 Description(SUDOKU)

This project implements a Sudoku Solver using the Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) approach. A partially filled 9×9 Sudoku grid is provided to the user through an interactive interface. The user can input values into empty cells, and the system validates the solution based on Sudoku rules. Additionally, the system can automatically solve the puzzle using a backtracking algorithm.

🧠 Algorithms Used

The solution is based on Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) techniques.

Backtracking Algorithm The solver tries numbers from 1 to 9 in empty cells. If a number violates any constraint, it backtracks and tries another value. Constraint Checking The following constraints are enforced: Each row must contain digits 1–9 without repetition Each column must contain digits 1–9 without repetition Each 3×3 subgrid must contain digits 1–9 without repetition

▶️ Execution Steps

Open the interactive website (Sudoku interface in browser) A partially filled Sudoku grid is displayed Enter values in the empty cells Click Check to validate your solution Click Solve to automatically fill the grid The system displays: “Solved!” if completed successfully “Wrong!” if constraints are violated

📊 Sample Output

A 9×9 Sudoku grid displayed in the browser Pre-filled cells are disabled (cannot be edited) User-entered values appear in input fields On clicking Solve, the grid is filled with the correct solution Alerts/messages displayed:

📄 Problem 1 Description (TIC TAC TOE)

This project implements an Interactive Tic-Tac-Toe Game with AI. The user plays against a computer opponent on a 3×3 grid through a web-based interface. The system uses an AI algorithm to determine the best possible move, ensuring optimal gameplay. The objective is to either win against the AI or force a draw.

🧠 Algorithms Used

Minimax Algorithm The AI evaluates all possible future game states and selects the move that maximizes its chances of winning while minimizing the opponent’s chances. Game Tree Search All possible moves are explored recursively to determine the optimal decision.

▶️ Execution Steps

Open the interactive website The game board (3×3 grid) is displayed Player makes a move by clicking on a cell (X) The AI automatically responds with its move (O) The game continues until: Player wins AI wins Draw occurs Click Restart to play again

📊 Sample Output

Interactive 3×3 grid displayed in browser Player moves shown as X, AI moves as O Smooth animations and hover effects Game result messages: “You Win!” “AI Wins!” “Draw!” “Solved!” → when solution is correct “Wrong!” → when constraints are violated
